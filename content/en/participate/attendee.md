# Attendee

COSCUP is different from other conferences because it is a **community-driven event**, organized by the open-source community. The conference features community tracks, workshops, BoFs, and more. Starting from 2020, COSCUP **no longer requires registration** or ticket purchase to participate. This change also gradually extends the "open-source spirit" from programming to other fields such as "design," "policy," "education," etc., providing a platform for practical sharing in various domains.

Due to this open format, first-time attendees of COSCUP are often overwhelmed by the plethora of session tracks. As an attendee, how should you participate in COSCUP? Here is a simple guide to help you have a unique and enriching experience over the two days of the conference.

## Schedule

COSCUP features open-source topics and sessions hosted by the open-source community. Therefore, at any given time, there are over 20 tracks running simultaneously. It's recommended to spend some time before the event browsing through the conference schedule and noting down the sessions that interest you.

Currently, there are two ways to view the schedule. Please choose the one that suits your reading preference:

1. [Offcial Schedule](https://coscup.org/2025/sessions/)：Designed for wide screens. Remember, there are more session tracks on the right side.

## BoF

What is a BoF? **Birds of a Feather** is a phrase originating from the proverb "Birds of a feather flock together," meaning "people of similar interests tend to group together." A BoF is an informal discussion meeting format that allows people with similar interests or professional backgrounds to gather during a conference, share experiences, and exchange insights. It enables participants to freely discuss various topics with others who share similar interests, characteristics, or backgrounds.

You can register the BoF activity you want to initiate in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iKpXqZxBr7tbBynhyIz4JMkXGi9XpldIU5BTjOVlSLM/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.fxmha6h81nfm). Examples include: "Giveaways Exchange: I have some giveaways from other conferences that I'd like to swap with others!" or "[PGP Key-signing Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signing_party)" (though, is anyone still using PGP these days?).

</figure>

Every year during the volunteer recruitment for the conference, some enthusiasts are unable to join or fully participate in the preparation process. Therefore, COSCUP has created the "One-Day Volunteer" initiative. This program allows volunteers who are passionate about contributing to the event to still have an opportunity to join us and make a difference during the two-day conference.

In addition to our core preparation team, we offer the "One-Day Volunteer" service mechanism. This is perfect for those who want to gain more insights into how COSCUP organizes its annual conference and provides services to the community and attendees. Roll up your sleeves and join us!

We currently have approximately 60 openings for "One-Day Volunteers." You can review the available positions and see how you can participate. If you have any questions, feel free to contact the administrative team or visit the TR 2F "Volunteer Service Desk" on the event day for more details.

</figure>

The Professional Portrait Photography service was first introduced in 2023. The Documentation Team selects a classroom to set up a professional photo studio for taking individual portrait. If you want your profile picture on job sites, personal websites, or social media to reflect your involvement in open source and convey a professional image, you can utilize the "Professional Portrait Photography" service.

Feel free to take advantage of this service to leave a lasting professional impression!

:::info Arrive Early

- This service is free of charge. Please arrive early to make a reservation or queue on-site. The photo studio is located at TR-413-1.
- If you hold a valid OSCVPass, you can claim a voucher for a printed headshot at TR-413-2.

</figure>

The event will be held in the TR building of NTUST. Each floor's bulletin board will feature a dedicated section planned by COSCUP for community use. We encourage you and your communities or companies to make good use of these bulletin boards to [post](https://www.flickr.com/photos/coscup/) information about **personal open-source projects**, **community introductions**, **event announcements**, or **even the annual schedules** of your communities — anything related to open-source promotion.

We hope that attendees and participants will also use the bulletin boards to obtain information about open-source communities. Even if your community doesn't have a dedicated booth at this year's event, the bulletin board is an excellent alternative for promotion.

Based on previous planning, approximately 20 flyers are needed to cover all bulletin boards. If you are interested in posting information, you can also refer to the Open Culture Foundation's flyer promotion methods at FOSDEM earlier this year [here](https://ocf.tw/en/p/global/fosdem-2024/).

:::info Flyer Size Recommendations

- **A4 Size**: Standard flyer, includes title, content, and QR Code link.
- **A5 Size**: Half the size of A4, suitable for creating a four-page brochure on a single A4 sheet for project or community introductions.
- **A6 Size**: One-quarter the size of A4, ideal for event promotion, project promotion, single-use QR Code flyers for surveys, etc.

It is recommended to design your layout using A4 size. For size adjustments, ask the staff at the copying or printing shop to output the flyers in A5 or A6 size.

## Taiwan Food Guide

This year at COSCUP, we've gathered a list of the food stalls currently open at the First Student Cafeteria of the Student Center. We hope that as you enter the NTUST campus to attend COSCUP, you'll also get to enjoy the fun of having student meals again.

- [Link to cafeteria info](https://github.com/COSCUP/NTUST-Foodlist)

We apologize that we couldn't complete the Taiwan Food Guide before the conference this year. However, we found some good content that we hope will make your visit special, especially if you're coming from another country to attend COSCUP!

Finally, we kindly ask you to complete the [Attendee Survey](https://coscup.org/2025-survey/). This will help us better understand the profile of COSCUP attendees. Since we've moved to an open, registration-free model, conducting this type of survey has become increasingly challenging. Your assistance in completing this survey would be greatly appreciated!
