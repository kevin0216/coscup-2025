# Attendee

COSCUP is different from other conferences because it is a **community-driven event**, organized by the open-source community. The conference features community tracks, workshops, BoFs, and more. Starting from 2020, COSCUP **no longer requires registration** or ticket purchase to participate. This change also gradually extends the "open-source spirit" from programming to other fields such as "design," "policy," "education," etc., providing a platform for practical sharing in various domains.

Due to this open format, first-time attendees of COSCUP are often overwhelmed by the plethora of session tracks. As an attendee, how should you participate in COSCUP? Here is a simple guide to help you have a unique and enriching experience over the two days of the conference.

## How to Get to COSCUP

Recommended routes to NTUST:

## Schedule

COSCUP features open-source topics and sessions hosted by the open-source community. Therefore, at any given time, there are over 20 tracks running simultaneously. It's recommended to spend some time before the event browsing through the conference schedule and noting down the sessions that interest you.

We‚Äôve also curated a list of [English-only sessions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YAENPqeSunVlXN-9dJPR0jaGAwa4rQVc/view?usp=sharing) and [program highlights](https://s.coscup.org/pro25rec) for you.

Our official schedule is best viewed on a wide screen. You‚Äôll find more session tracks listed on the right side, so be sure to scroll over and check them out.

## BoF

What is a BoF? **Birds of a Feather** is a phrase originating from the proverb "Birds of a feather flock together," meaning "people of similar interests tend to group together." A BoF is an informal discussion meeting format that allows people with similar interests or professional backgrounds to gather during a conference, share experiences, and exchange insights. It enables participants to freely discuss various topics with others who share similar interests, characteristics, or backgrounds.

You can register the BoF activity you want to initiate in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iKpXqZxBr7tbBynhyIz4JMkXGi9XpldIU5BTjOVlSLM/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.fxmha6h81nfm). Examples include: "Giveaways Exchange: I have some giveaways from other conferences that I'd like to swap with others!" or "[PGP Key-signing Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signing_party)" (though, is anyone still using PGP these days?).

</figure>

Every year during the volunteer recruitment for the conference, some enthusiasts are unable to join or fully participate in the preparation process. Therefore, COSCUP has created the "One-Day Volunteer" initiative. This program allows volunteers who are passionate about contributing to the event to still have an opportunity to join us and make a difference during the two-day conference.

In addition to our core preparation team, we offer the "One-Day Volunteer" service mechanism. This is perfect for those who want to gain more insights into how COSCUP organizes its annual conference and provides services to the community and attendees. Roll up your sleeves and join us!

You can review the available positions and see how you can participate. If you have any questions, feel free to contact the task owner or visit the TR 2F Information Desk on the event day for more details.

<VPButton href="https://volunteer.coscup.org/tasks/2025">Join Us! "One-Day Volunteer"</VPButton>

## Individual Supporter Program

COSCUP is entirely organized by volunteers and offers free admission to everyone without selling tickets. For the past 20 years, COSCUP has always been **a conference built by the community, for the community**.

To keep this open source stage going and ensure open exchange continues, we sincerely invite you to become an individual supporter of COSCUP. Every contribution helps build the next COSCUP‚Äîand the one after that!
