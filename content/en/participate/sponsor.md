# Sponsorship Partners

First and foremost, thank you for sponsoring COSCUP, the Conference for Open Source Coders, Users and Promoters. Whether you support us through "individual sponsorship" or "corporate sponsorship," we greatly appreciate your support. COSCUP has been running for almost 20 years, and from the very first year, there has been no need to buy tickets to attend. We have grown from a small conference of about 100 attendees to over 3000 participants. Sponsorship partners not only provide support in terms of venue, promotion, marketing, and documentation, but also help with the accommodation and catering for the volunteer team every year.
